# Time-series-forecasting
The following code implements ten forecasting model algorithms, including some hybrid models for time series forecasting. The considered models are ARIMA, ES, SSA-R, LSTM, ARIMA-LSTM, ES-LSTM, SSA-R-LSTM, SSA-ARIMA-LSTM, SSA-ES-LSTM, and SSA-LSTM-LSTM. The code provides results based on the Rand to U.S. Dollar exchange rate (DEXSFUS.csv). Additionally, four other datasets are available in the data folder and can easily be adapted to the code. These datasets include Crude Oil Prices (DCOILBRENTEU.csv), the NASDAQ index (NQ.csv), temperature data (temp_yde_.csv), and solar radiation data (rad_yde_.csv) for the city of Yaound√©. We aim to forecast all 20 observations based on the built models. First, we forecast the 20 observations using the model forecasts alone, and then we perform a forecast based on the test set. RMSE and SMAPE metrics are used for comparison.
The code is divided into two parts: in R, we build the statistical model and also perform SSA (Rand_data_single_models_and_saved_residuals.R). In Python, we implement the LSTM models on the residuals, build the hybrid models, and compute the metrics for all the models.
